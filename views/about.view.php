            <p class="txt-margin">The Jack Mattsson Foundation was established in 2018 to honor our son/brother Jack and his wishes after losing a battle against Osteosarcoma in 2017.
            Nobody fought the fight better than he.
            So many people made a tremendous impact on Jack and our family during the battle.
            Family, friends, community, and strangers all were part of Jack’s Army and showed tremendous compassion and generosity during Jack’s difficult times.
            We are forever grateful and aim to give back and pay forward to others who have trying times.</p>

        <p class="txt-margin">While rare, Osteosarcoma is the most common type of Bone Cancer. The cancer usually begins in the cells that
            form bones and is most often found in the long bones. Osteosarcoma tends to occur in teenagers and young
            adults but can also occur in young children and older adults.</p>
