                <p>The Jack Mattsson Foundation was established in 2018 to honor our son/brother Jack and his wishes after losing a battle against Osteosarcoma in 2017.
                    Nobody fought the fight better than he.
                    So many people made a tremendous impact on Jack and our family during the battle.
                    Family, friends, community, and strangers all were part of Jack’s Army and showed tremendous compassion and generosity during Jack’s difficult times.
                    We are forever grateful and aim to give back and pay forward to others who have trying times.</p>
